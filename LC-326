326. Power of Three
Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Follow up:
Could you do it without using any loop / recursion?

class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        int maxPowerThree = (int)pow(3, (int)(log(0x7fffffff)/log(3)));
        return n>0 && maxPowerThree%n == 0;
    }
};

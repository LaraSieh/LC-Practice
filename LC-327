327. Count of Range Sum
Given an integer array nums, return the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper] inclusive.
Range sum S(i, j) is defined as the sum of the elements in nums between indices i and j (i ≤ j), inclusive.

Note:
A naive algorithm of O(n2) is trivial. You MUST do better than that.

Example:
Given nums = [-2, 5, -1], lower = -2, upper = 2,
Return 3.
The three ranges are : [0, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.


// anyway first brute force, o(n^2) though time limit exceeds:)
class Solution {
public:
    int countRangeSum(vector<int>& nums, int lower, int upper) {
        int n = nums.size();
        
        int count=0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) {
            int sum=0;
            for (int j=i; j<n; ++j) {
                sum += nums[j];
                if (sum>=lower && sum<=upper) {
                    ++count;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

// 70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int first=1, second=1,ways=0;
        if (n<2) return n;
        
        for (int i=1; i<n; ++i) { // ith loop for i+1 step
            ways = first + second;
            second = first;
            first = ways;
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
};

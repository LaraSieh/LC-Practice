// Flip game

// Problem Description:
// You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: 
// Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, 
//you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer 
// make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

// Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.
// For example, given s = "++++", return true. The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

//The idea is very straightforward: if you can make s non-winnable by a move, then you will win.

class Solution {
  public:
    bool canWin(string s) {
         for (int i = -1; (i = s.find("++", i + 1)) >= 0; )
             if (!canWin(s.substr(0, i) + '-' + s.substr(i+2)))
                 return true;
         return false;
     }
 };
